# Counting Trees through Satellite Images
 
From the satellite image above you can see that manually counting the trees can be a very tedious task. Fortunately, there are several techniques for automating tree counting. Morphological operations and classical segmentation algorithms like the watershed algorithm have been applied to tree counting with limited success so far. However, in case of dense areas, the trees are more densely packed and the crowns of the tress often overlap. These areas probably show different forest characteristics, such as differences in crown structure, species diversity, openness of tree crowns. This makes the problem more difficult. Therefore the tree counting algorithm has to be more robust and intelligent. This is where deep learning comes into play.
